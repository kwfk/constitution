## I. ELECTIONS

### 0. Town Hall

1. Prior to collecting nomasdfasdfasdfinations for all executive roles, there should be a general meeting dedicated to reflection, concerns, and prospective changes in a town hall format with the following procedures.
2. Executive Committee gives a reflection of their semester goals and what they have achieved. These reflections are not intended to be a mark of whether or not they were successful but rather a candid explanation of what they were able to do in the role. All reflections will be made public and maintained for future semesters to see.
3. Following the reflection, there will be a club-wide discussion regarding the state of Blueprint, general concerns, and potential directions for future semesters.

### 1. Nominations

1. Executive Committee must collect nominations for all executive roles starting at least two weeks before the day of an election.
2. Eligible members may be nominated and run for multiple positions, but they are bound to the first role they win in election.
3. A nominee must run for a position unless they withdraw their nomination before a date and time set by the Executive Committee.
4. Nominations outside the nomination period may be added at the discretion of the Executive Committee with the consent of the nominee.

### 2. Election Rules

1. Order of elections for each role is the president, then the constitutional order of contested positions, then the constitutional order of non-contested positions.
2. Members who are graduating or intend to become permanently inactive (i.e. they do not intend to be active in Blueprint for the rest of their college career) cannot vote during their final semester. However, if they intend to return to Blueprint after a period of inactivity, then they are eligible to vote.
3. In the case that there are more than 2 candidates running for a single position, the Executive Committee will implement instant runoff voting. A candidate is selected if they receive the majority of votes in their favor (> 50 %). If not, the candidate with the least votes will be eliminated and the votes that went to the eliminated candidate will be allocated to the next highest candidate chosen by the voter. This will continue until a candidate receives a majority of the votes.
4. In the case that 2 candidates or less run for a position, a candidate will be elected if they receive a majority of the votes. If no candidate receives a majority vote, the candidate(s) shall leave the room to allow for group discussion that lasts 5 to 10 minutes. After this group discussion, the group shall recast votes. This will repeat until a candidate receives the majority.

### 3. Election Procedures

#### a. Uncontested Positions

## II. MEMBERSHIP

### 1. Inactive Members

1. Members may choose to become inactive at the end of each semester. They may choose to become an active member again at the end of their inactive semester, but this does not guarantee their original role is still available to them (i.e. Director of Operations member goes inactive and Blueprint recruits a new Director of Operations).
2. Members may not choose to become inactive during their first semester in Blueprint unless there are extenuating circumstances. The Executive Committee will be charged with hearing extenuating circumstances. If any member of The Executive Committee agrees with the extenuating circumstance, then the member may go inactive. If The Executive Committee unanimously disagrees with the extenuating circumstance, then the member will be asked to reapply for their respective role during the following semester.

### 2. Transferring Teams

1. If a member wants to switch to a role they have not previously held (between External member, developer, and designer), they must complete a shortened application process for that role at the end of the previous semester.
2. The internal application process will gauge the skillsets that vary between the previous and desired roles and will be managed by the incoming executive team.
3. In the scenario in which a transferring member is not accepted to the role they desire, then they have the option to return to their previous role or take up a complementary role in Blueprint as defined in Section 3 Complementary Roles.

### 3. Complementary Roles

1. At the end of each semester, any member may choose to be in a complementary role for Blueprint. This includes working under The President, Internal Vice President, VP of Projects, or VP of Technology in a new role with objectives planned out by The Executive Committee member and the general member.
2. Complementary role members will present their work at general meetings like any other team.
